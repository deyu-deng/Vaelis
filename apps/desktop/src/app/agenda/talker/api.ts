/**
 * Talker collection status — the data side of A7 (see
 * `docs/specs/slice-map-v1.md` A7).
 *
 * Backed by the collector's `vaelis/collectors/chatlog/state.py` status table
 * through `/api/collect/*` (mounted in `hermes_cli/web_server.py`). The board
 * entry consumes this module unchanged; the backend owns the truth.
 *
 * Privacy contract (ADR-0010, fail-closed): a brand-new talker is NEVER
 * collected by default — it surfaces as `pending` for a one-click
 * collect/exclude. `reviewComplete` stays false on first enable, during which
 * nothing is collected.
