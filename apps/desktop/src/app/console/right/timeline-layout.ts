/**
 * Day-axis layout for the L1 right-rail agenda timeline (R-009 / R-020 / R-031.1).
 *
 * Pure math, no React and no i18n — `timeline.tsx` renders exactly what this
 * returns, and the vitest suite pins the arithmetic (hour span, block height,
 * open-ended events, side-by-side columns) without mounting anything.
 *
 * Three block lanes share the same axis:
 *   - `event` — the real agenda rows (the user's meetings / events);
 *   - `anchor` — the day's routine blocks (sleep / meals) shown as a soft
 *     background band; never actionable;
 *   - `plan` — planned project work, drawn in the same anchor lane.
 *
 * Rules that come straight from the rulings:
 * - The axis always shows at least 08:00 → 23:00 and stretches to fit anything
 *   outside that window, so an early or late entry is never clipped away.
 * - A block's height follows `start_at` → `end_at`. A missing `end_at` is NOT
 *   stretched into a fake hour: it gets the minimum height and is flagged
 *   `openEnded` so the UI can say「未写结束」.
 * - Side-by-side overlaps (裁定 31.1 / 36.2): all lanes share one grid, so
 *   blocks that collide in time — even across lanes — split into columns and
 *   each takes `1 / columnCount` of the axis width, where columnCount is the
 *   widest column of that block's own overlap cluster. Only the blocks whose
 *   intervals actually intersect are flagged `overlaps`. Open-ended blocks do
 *   NOT participate in the overlap test — they'd swallow a column.
 * - A block's vertical position is `topPx` (px from the axis top); the renderer
 *   MUST apply it, otherwise every block stacks at the top (裁定 32.1).
