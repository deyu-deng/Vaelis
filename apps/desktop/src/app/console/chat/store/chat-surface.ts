/**
 * Console agenda-propose helper (spec §3.6 shared pending-event card).

 * The console's L1/L2 conversation no longer lives in a console-local store:
 * per ARCH-RULINGS 2026-09-02 the center reuses the base session store + gateway
 * path (the same `$messages` / `submitText` the full-screen chat uses), so there
 * is no scope-keyed message map, no `sendChat`, and no mock transport here.
 *
 * This module keeps only the `agenda_propose` tool-part builder shared by the
 * agenda right rail and any future console composer that wants to inject a
 * confirmation card into the (base) message stream.
