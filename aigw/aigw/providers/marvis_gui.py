"""Tencent Marvis (marvis.qq.com) provider via GUI automation.

Tencent's consumer Marvis is a *native* system-level GUI app (WinML / OpenVINO /
NPU, NOT Electron) with no CLI and no inbound API. It therefore cannot use the
spawn-CLI route (marvis_cli.py). The only compliant-ish way to use its quota
from aigw is the GUI analog of spawn-CLI: drive its chat box like a human
(see aigw/providers/gui.py for the full engine + CAVEATS).

All control selectors are config-driven; run `aigw marvis-dump` on the target
Windows machine to discover them. See aigw/docs/GUI_AUTOMATION.md.
