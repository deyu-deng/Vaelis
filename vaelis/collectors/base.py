"""Pluggable collector surface (WP-COLLECTOR-ICS).

Every source — WeChat chatlog today, timetable .ics and DingTalk tomorrow —
implements :class:`Collector` and yields :class:`Occurrence` rows. Landing in
the agenda always goes through
:func:`vaelis.collectors.ingest.ingest_occurrences` so no source can fork the
storage semantics (pending vs confirmed, dedupe, ADR-0009 change diffs).

An ``Occurrence`` is one *concrete* event: a weekly course repeated 16 times
is 16 occurrences, each with its own stable ``external_id``.
