"""Shared landing path for every collector (WP-COLLECTOR-ICS).

One function, one set of semantics — chatlog, timetable ics and future sources
all call :func:`ingest_occurrences`; none of them talks to the store directly.

Dedupe contract: an item is identified by ``(source, evidence["uid"] or
external_id)``. Collectors that carry a richer source id put it in
``evidence["uid"]``; otherwise ``external_id`` is the key.

Behaviour matrix (mirrors the task ruling / ADR-0009):

* no existing row, ``apply="pending"``   → ``ingest_candidate`` (pending card)
* no existing row, ``apply="confirmed"`` → ``create_from_source`` (straight to
  confirmed; never fakes ``source="manual"``)
* existing row and title/start/end changed → ``ingest_candidate(...,
  target_event_id=existing)`` → pending change with ``prev_value`` snapshot
* existing row, nothing changed           → skip (``unchanged``)
* a row missing from this pull is NEVER deleted — sources are additive.

Change-target seam: chatlog's reschedule matcher (``_find_change_target``)
sets ``evidence["target_event_id"]`` when the message re-schedules a known
event. This module consumes (pops) that key and turns it into
``ingest_candidate(target_event_id=...)``; it never reaches stored evidence,
so the snippet-only evidence contract stays intact.
