"""Collect → filter → confirm → ingest.

Order matters and is the privacy contract:

1. scope       — `CollectorConfig.mode` decides which talkers are in scope:
                  blacklist enumerates every conversation and drops blacklisted
                  ones (empty blacklist = all); whitelist reads only named
                  talkers (fail-closed).
2. dedupe      — webhook and sweep both deliver; only one wins
3. local rules — on-device; decides what may leave the machine at all
4. confirm     — heuristic first, model only for the remainder (snippet only)
5. ingest      — lands as ``pending`` for the human to confirm (ADR-0009)
