"""Turning a rule hit into a concrete agenda candidate.

Two implementations behind one protocol:

- :class:`HeuristicConfirmer` — deterministic, on-device, zero token cost.
  Handles the common shapes ("明天下午三点开会") and refuses anything it cannot
  pin to a real time. It anchors relative dates on the message's **own sent
  time** (``message.sent_at``), never on the wall clock, and it never invents a
  clock — a date with no stated hour is handed to the model instead of being
  defaulted to a fake 9:00.
- an LLM confirmer (L2, cheap model) can be dropped in later for the messy
  remainder. Only the matched snippet (plus, per the narrow WP-EXTRACT-CONTEXT
  opening, the ±1 neighbour snippets) may be sent (ADR-0010); L1 never does
  this work (ADR-0011).
