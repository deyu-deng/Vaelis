"""Board-facing collection API: the first-run review and the pending queue.

Mounted at ``/api/collect`` (see ``hermes_cli/web_server.py``). Consumed by
``apps/desktop/src/app/agenda/talker/api.ts`` — the desktop board's "session
collection" entry (A7 slice).

Contract (matches the desktop store):

* ``GET /api/collect/talkers``
      -> {reviewComplete: bool, talkers: [{id, name, status}]}
      status is one of known/excluded/pending; an unreviewed talker is
      reported as ``pending`` (board: "new session awaiting your decision")
      without being written to the status table.
* ``POST /api/collect/talkers/{talker}/mode``  body {mode: "collect"|"exclude"}
      -> {id, status}
      One-click collect/exclude from the board.
* ``POST /api/collect/talkers/bulk``  body {talkers: [...], status}
      Batch decision for the first-run review ("排除这批").
* ``POST /api/collect/review-complete``
      -> {reviewComplete: true}
      Flips the first-run gate; until this is called blacklist mode sweeps
      nothing (ADR-0010 revision). Completing the review also (a) bulk-excludes
      official accounts (``gh_*``) that are still pending — talkers the user
      already marked known/excluded are never rewritten (verdict 23) — and
      (b) kicks a background 3-day lookback sweep over every known talker so
      the board fills immediately instead of waiting for the next watchdog
      tick. The response returns at once; a failed sweep only logs and never
      rolls the review flag back.
* ``POST /api/collect/sweep``  optional query ``lookback_days`` (default 3)
      -> IngestReport dict
      On-demand lookback sweep over every known talker. Refuses with 409
      until the first-run review has completed (ADR-0010 fail-closed).
