"""§8.2 narrow hard route: two frozen L1 utterances → ``vaelis_secretary_ask``.

WP-BE-13 / ARCH-RULINGS 2026-09-08 裁定 21.1.

The 2026-09-08 live-window acceptance proved SOUL soft routing is not enough:
sentence ① (「明天的日常安排是什么」) produced **zero** tool calls and the L1
secretary invented a schedule from memory (and falsely announced chatlog was
down).  Sentence ② did reach the tool, so the tool itself is fine — only the
routing decision is unreliable.  This module pins the tool *entry point* for
exactly those two utterances.

Scope discipline (裁定 21.1, and the task's 禁止 list):

* The match table holds the two frozen utterances **verbatim**.  The only
  accepted variants are leading/trailing whitespace and a single trailing
  full-width ``？`` or half-width ``?`` question mark.
* There is **no keyword table**.  「明天几点开会？」 must NOT match — anything
  else that merely contains 明天 falls through to the model untouched, and no
  other user utterance is ever skipped/answered here.
* Which L2 actually runs stays inside the tool (name-list routing / S2 spawn).
  No agent id and no business name other than ``agenda``'s intent enum is
  written down here.
* Anti-fabrication: the rewrite instructs the model to answer only from the
  tool JSON, and to say merely "采集不通" when ``ok=false`` / ``dead=true``
  instead of announcing a concrete component failure from memory.

The hook returns ``{"action": "rewrite", "text": ...}`` — the same shape the
existing ``pre_gateway_dispatch`` rewrite precedent uses (see
``plugins/vaelis-north-star/__init__.py::_on_pre_gateway_dispatch``).
